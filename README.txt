DDDG Extended Captions becoming a caption to my text


Expanded publication

It might be possible that (today’s common) practice of a “self-reflexive publishing” started with the magazine Dot Dot Dot, published by graphic designers’ “collective” Dexter Sinister; a lot has been written on Dexter Sinister’s projects, and many of these writings were made by themselves and printed on the pages of the same project they are referring to or in a related publication.
In ten years of Dot Dot Dot (issue 1 to 21), and its parallel exhibition project (DDDA to DDDH), Dexter Sinister brought together experimentation and theorization, playing with the conventions of publishing, extending it further and further. Extending also the category of graphic design magazine towards something drifting between a lot of disciplines, composing these different worlds into something that is not easilly defined, and that keeps on changing definition.

The project DDDG Extended Caption is a good door to enter in the world of Dot Dot Dot.
DDDG Extended Caption is both the 7th exhibition of the original items published in the magazine Dot Dot Dot at Culturgest (Lisbon), and a book bringing together all the articles of Dot Dot Dot in whiche these items appear.
DDDG Extended Caption questions the hierarchy of images and text on paper and on a wall.
DDDG Extended Caption is a good door to enter in the world of Dot Dot Dot, at first because it is not yet out of print by the time these lines are written.

From these to the Serving Library -> digital

Expanded publication
After hundreds of years of normalisation of “publishing” in one medium by the printing press, we are today ready for an expanded conception of publication, as it has already been the case before, for instance in orality-transmission societies, or in the manuscripts culture. 
Publishing is making things public.

Manuscripts -> extended captions
Copy + development, comments etc.


The digital culture in which we live is also a very fertile field for this potential expansion of the forms of making things public.
Terms like parallel publishing address the multiplicity of formats and publics for one content. Situated in the context of open access, the expression means publishing a (academic) paper both in a regular journal and on an open access platform, allowing anyone to freely access it.
